# Search for a CLI tooling or how to consume NODE JS native args

Couple options. I've chosen Commander.



## Search arg

default implicit input is SEARCH

it should accept several words (to be used as a single search term)

## Results arg

a second input param is RESULTS that takes an integer. 

This is the number of browser tabs that should be opened

# How to open a browser based on the CLI inputs
# Run a search on duck duck go
# Use input term as “search keyword”
# Capture the search results (and save it for possible later usage)
# Parse the results, capturing the links
# Open 1 (or more depending on RESULTS input) Browser tabs with the captured link
